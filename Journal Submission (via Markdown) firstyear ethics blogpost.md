### The spelling and look of the keyword was not the only change that occurred to it during these time periods, the meaning and use of the word had some slight changes but relativity stayed the same. Since the period of the words' first recorded use, the word ethics has pretty much always had the same meaning as a study on moral principles. The keyword of ethics has also gone through many time periods where it is used all the time and where it is barely used.  Even in the time period where the word originated from the word ethics only really had around 1.6- 2 frequency per million words, it wasn't until 1890 that ethics had a big jump in uses massing over 9.6 frequency per million words that decade.  The decline of the keyword's frequency recently started again in 2019 where in 2023 it reached a low of 0.3 frequency per a million words. 

### The changing and importance of ethics can also be seen throughout many famous books and authors such as Aristotle[^1] and the many books that he created. The reason why Aristotle is important to this keyword is because of how much of an influence he had on the creation of the keyword today. Aristotle talked throughout many of his books about political ethics or how the ethics and morals of your upbringing are very important. Many of Aristotle's thoughts and meanings behind ethics are told throughout many books and by many different authors, even in today's time, you can see the impact that Aristotle has had on defining the keyword of ethics. Overall the keyword of ethics has gone through many changes big and small whether that be the way it's spelt or communicated or the meaning of the actual keyword. Authors like Aristotle continued to bring relevancy and meaning to the world and have influenced how the word is depicted in modern-day society with the definition of “Moral principles, or a system of these.”
